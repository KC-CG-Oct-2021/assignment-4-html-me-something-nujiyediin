         <h3>According to the U.S. Postal Service, letters and cards have been on the decline for the past 20 years. But that hasn&apos;t stopped some millennials and Gen Z enthusiasts from using snail mail.</h3>

            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Nikita Imafidon is a long-time letter writer. Growing up, the 24-year-old used to meet her pen pals on the blogging site Tumblr. During the early days of the pandemic, she began putting extra effort into her missives, adding doodles and details to the letters she wrote to coworkers and friends she couldn&apos;t see in person.</p>
            <p>&quot;It just became more of a way of both record-keeping, as well as being able to be like, &apos;Hey, I&apos;m really curious about how you&apos;re doing,&apos;&quot; she said. &quot;It just became more of an art form to me.&quot;</p>
            <p>Now that she&apos;s able to work and see people in person again, she hasn&apos;t stopped. She gets inspiration from Pinterest and from her job as a stationery seller at the gift and art supply store Wonder Fair in Lawrence.</p>

            <p class="photo-caption">At Wonder Fair, stationery and card sales rose about 20% in 2020.</p>

            <p>And she&apos;s not the only young person who has combined her love of physical mail with the internet and turned to more tangible forms of communication â€” at a time when most people are just a text or Zoom call away. Despite 20 years of U.S. Postal Service data showing a decline in households sending and receiving letters and greeting cards, snail mail remains a beloved pastime for many millennials and members of Gen Z.</p>
            <p>Social media has inspired many customers in their teens and 20s, said Meredith Moore, co-owner of Wonder Fair. The store used to sell materials for sealing letters with wax to mostly older hobbyists, but that&apos;s changed now that TikTok, Instagram and YouTube videos of wax sealing and stationery design have become trendy.</p>
            <p>&quot;Those videos are extremely popular and that popularity just keeps growing,&quot; Moore said. &quot;So people see it online and then they&apos;d like to try it themselves.&quot;</p>

         <section class="story-text">
            <p>At Wonder Fair, sales of writing materials like stationery and cards rose about 20% in 2020, Moore said, and have risen 30% each year since then. The store used to sell most of its cards around holidays like Christmas and Mother&apos;s Day. Now, cards sell briskly year-round.</p>
            <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s pandemic-related, but maybe people are starting to really appreciate their families as they&apos;re apart,&quot; Moore said.</p>
            <p>At Kansas City-based greeting card giant Hallmark, sales of cards for essential workers like teachers and delivery drivers are up. The company declined to share information about how overall sales had changed during the pandemic. But humorous cards, religious cards and cards not geared toward any specific occasion have also been popular during the past two years, said Nicole Hite-Heleniak, Hallmark&apos;s vice president of creative and product development.</p>
            <p>Millennials represent almost 20% of the money spent in the greeting card industry, she said. They&apos;re in the life stages when people most often send cards: marriage, childbirth, getting a first job. And Gen Z is starting to enter those stages.</p>
            <p>&quot;They&apos;re looking to greeting cards as a way to inject some positivity into the world, their lives and their relationships,&quot; Hite-Heleniak said.</p>
